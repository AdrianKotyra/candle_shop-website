# Candle shop Website
##  Project Overview

For my first foray into ecommerce website development, I embarked on creating a candle shop website. This project was a group effort, with me serving as the sole developer. Despite its simplicity, it provided a valuable learning experience as I delved into PHP and SQL to create a functional and dynamic website.

One of the key features of the website was user registration functionality, powered by PHP and integrated with an online SQL database.

To populate the website with products, I utilized PHP to fetch data from the SQL database and dynamically render product listings. This ensured that the website could easily scale with the addition of new products or changes to existing ones.

While the website's functionality was the primary focus, I also incorporated elements of design and interactivity. Leveraging my skills in JavaScript, I implemented custom animations and modal windows from scratch, enhancing the user experience and adding a touch of flair to the site.

Though it was a simple project, creating this candle shop website was a rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of PHP, SQL, and JavaScript in a real-world scenario, while also honing my skills in web development and design. Overall, it served as an excellent foundation for future endeavors in ecommerce website development.

In addition to the user registration functionality and dynamic product rendering, I further enhanced the user experience by implementing AJAX to eliminate the need for page reloads. This allowed for seamless browsing and interaction with the website, making the shopping experience more fluid and responsive.

Furthermore, I developed the shopping basket feature from scratch using PHP sessions arrays. Leveraging this, users could add products to their basket and view them in real-time without the need for database interactions. This approach streamlined the checkout process and provided a more efficient shopping experience for users.
